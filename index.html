<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>Here in the path lies a white dog.</p>
<p>"Wwaf, Wwaf!"</p>
<p>That's its manner of greetings.</p>
<p>It loves pats. Give it a hug and it'll curle up around your feet .</p>
<p>"I've had a taste of solitude, www, when I was a stray in the deserts."</p>
<p>"Embraces cure insecurity."</p>
<p>"Wwaf, Wwaf!"</p>
